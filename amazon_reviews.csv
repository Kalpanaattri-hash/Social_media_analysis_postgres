They would always fit.  This is no longer true.  The quality of this brand has been slipping for years, and now it's to the point to where I think I need to find a new brand to buy.  It is hard enough to find 32x32 jeans, and about 1 in 4 that I try on won't fit right at all.  Nearly every pair suffers from the ""leg-twist,"" which is caused when the manufacturer cuts the bolt off-grain (this condition frequently gets worse after you wash.)  Other less frequent issues (but noticeably more common these days) would be crooked seams, crooked/misplaced tags, missing rivets, and uneven leg-lengths.  It seems that Levi's has been moving to thinner textiles, which means the jeans will wear out faster.Hopefully the quality returns.

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00012O12A,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon.  The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer.  They were durable and fit well.  They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing (I estimate around 40-50 washes).  So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work.  I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own.  But I wanted the less 'slim' fit of the 505s for work, also wanted the regular and not low rise waist.  So I ordered the same exact size and style:Bad idea!The 505s I got came with a tag saying 'sits below waist', which is NOT what they used to say.  Before, the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s.  Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon, I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair.  Trying the new pair on, I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my 'man parts' being crushed in agonizing ways.  No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans, and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area.  The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s, but the seat was the main difference.  No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505.And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s (in the same color as the new 505s I purchased) I noticed something interesting.  The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s.  It wasn't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing.  The 515s never felt that tough, and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description (no mention of low rise waist) and inferior quality.  I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store.  The previous 505s were also great (Fred Meyer of all places - though they don't have the 505s anymore... booo).  So I'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them.  I'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood.  And the better quality denim means they'll last longer anyway.  So here are my comparisons:Levi's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described, and that the quality appears to vary from order to order.  I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews.  I love Levi's jeans, and I will continue to buy them, but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing.  And remember, if you buy from Amazon, they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items.",1,Not the same as they once were ~,1347494400,2012-09-13 00:00:00

Allowing for the fact that gold has increased, all the same, if you buy these at the current price of around $140, you will be disappointed, notwithstanding the supposed, and inflated, retail price.  Why?  While they are pretty, these are very lightweight and fragile.  They have held up over five years, but I am very careful with them and don't wear them that often.

The only interior layout this bag has is a four-part partition quadrant held in place by velcro. If you remove the partition, it's just an empty space with no partitians.The quadrant partitian is moveable left and right from extreme side to side.  However, the partitians inside the quadrant itself are not adjustable.  You cannot adjust the sizes of the four partitians inside this moveable quadrant which is the only partitian system in this bag.I could not fit my Canon EF 100-400 L IS into any of the equally sized partitians inside the quadrant.  I could have moved the quadrant all the way to one side, but then the slot would have been too large for the lens and would have left no place for my Canon 30D.  The fixed partitian quadrant takes up over 2/3rds of the interior of the bag.Taking the quadrant partitian out, leaves you an empty cavity necessitating using the cases your lens came in....unless you're ok with them just rattling around in there.If you have small, thin lenses...this might work.....but there is no customizing of the interior partitian arrangement.If this bag had moveable, individually adjustable partitian panels, it would be wonderful.  With only one non-adjusting quadrant....it was not acceptable.A very minor point:  I didn't like the clips on the front holding the top flap down, two of them, are very small.  The clips need to be updated with either larger ones or the plastic type used by many bag manufacturers.....retro is nice, but a little updating is also good.Thank you Amazon for standing behind your sales; I returned the bag.",3,Not very Versatile,1213056000,2008-10-06 00:00:00

I have tried Hanes and other Jockey bikinis, and found them NOT low rise even when they claimed to be.  Elance in the black color has been the lowest rise of all and works ok for both jeans and working out.  They are not as sexy as I had hoped for, but at this point, I'll take what ever I can get.  They are comfortable, true to size and of good quality.This was originally a 4 star review.  And the BLACK color I ordered still is, see above.  However, I also ordered the pink/ivory/peach color combination because I loved the black so much.  I was disappointed.  I ordered the same size, and the package and tags say bikini, but they do not fit like the same pantie.  They are baggy and the rise is much higher than the black, by 1.5 inches (AFTER washing in hot water and drying on high temp).  These are not low rise as the description and box claim.  These panties show above my MID rise jeans (when standing, I do not have to sit for them to show), and I don't mean they ""peak"".  At least 3/4 of an inch shows in the back.  In my opinion, these fit like high cut briefs, not low rise bikinis.  I have tried so many styles to try to find LOW rise, 100%  cotton underwear.  I thought I had found something close enough to work in the black.  This other color just doesn't cut it for me, and I am now hesitant to order more of the black.  Will they fit like the first set I bought?  Or will it be more wasted money?  I will keep this order to wear while working out.  They won't show under my karate uniform, but I have yet again wasted money one something that does not live up to its description or my expectations.  I don't think expecting consistency between colors is too much to ask.  I mean come on, a 1.5 inch difference in the rise?UPDATE: I have since ordered a package of white and a package of gray shades. The package of white was, again, larger and higher in the rise, not as bad as before, only about 0.5 inch difference, but enough that the fabric bunched and wrinkled because the fit was too large.

I agree with other reviewers that the supplied thin PU insole is laughably thin, and non supportive, creating a false aura of roominess and comfort which does not stand up to(pun intended) prolonged non-recumbency. It DOES NOT have the ADIPRENE insoles that most other Rockports do. The unusually THICK TONGUE covers most of the dorsum (Top) of the foot....and competes for room...you have to open up the laces wide to accommodate it, or your arch top will start hurting. I tried a comfort insole, but it left little room for my toes. I banished the shoe to the back of my rack. Recently(after 3 months), I revisited the shoe, and remembered my previous travails. I trashed the insole first. Then I progressively stuffed paper napkins into the toe and ball area, leaving it overnight for a few days, to stretch it.

It has a wide flat platform, and is great/stable for standing, but not as good as some other more modern designs for prolonged walking.

I had no trouble inserting them and little difficulty putting the back on. Even my big man's fingers were able to put the back on the post. Maybe it was beginner's luck because I have struggled with other stud earrings with equally small backs.I like the 5mm size. It seems to be just the right size for a man.

That made me very happy I ordered them.UPDATE after 2 months: Well, they were nice while they lasted. It's a good thing I have that spare earring. I've had to change this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. The ear nuts that came with them are apparently a little loose. I lost one earring after wearing it for about a week so I've purchased replacement ear nuts. Hopefully they will work better than the originals.To be honest, I wear an earring 24/7 including when sleeping or showering.  I've been doing that for several years and this is the first time I've completely lost an earring. I've had some come loose but they loosened gradually enough that I always felt it before the ear nut came off completely. The reviewed earring must have come loose and fallen out quickly enough that I didn't feel anything.FURTHER UPDATE: I found the earring that had fallen out and tried a spare ear nut on it. I had purchased several different sizes here on Amazon and found an ear nut that fit snugly enough I don't think I have to worry about it coming off.

This is why I sized down to their 32DDD for this sports bra. It supports from the band but does not lay completely flat in the front center. If you are in-between sizes like me, know that this will not be an absolutely perfect fit. I love the adjustable straps though.This is also a great bra for low-impact exercise. It definitely minimizes side-to-side bounce. However, for high-impact, I have to layer it with a compression bra to ensure minimization of up-and-down. This could be partly because it is a cotton material with soft cups (no padding or contouring). Also, cotton is not the best for major sweat-sessions; so keep that in mind.I ordered this one for the low price. It does encase the breast tissue; but it does not look as pretty as some other sport bras for women with bigger cup sizes (e.g. my breast shape is round/full on top, but this bra make me look fuller on bottom).

That being said, you'll note I still gave this watch 3 stars.  It is what it is, as the cliche' goes.  For an $8.95 watch, this fits the bill as a work in the yard/garage knock around watch.  It is water resistant (which means oil resistant) and in spite of the smaller than expected face, it is readable and has a pleasant ""wheat"" color to it dial.Right out of the box, I saw the good and bad in this inexpensive timepiece and immediately ordered a cheap ""Swiss Type"" nylon and pleather 16mm band (from Amazon, of course).  So, for $20 I have a custom watch which I think will take a reasonable beating  thus saving wear and tear on my better watches.  It has a plastic crystal, is super lightweight and likely will not become a family heirloom.  But, it fills a need and looks decent with the addition of the better watchband.If, like me, you are a person who feels lost without a watch and need an inexpensive beater, this will fit the bill. But, I cannot emphasize enough how cheesy and cheap the band is. It takes a 16mm and if you order this watch, consider picking out a $10 band to go with it.  You will the have $20-ish  invested, so when shopping for comparable watches keep that price point in mind.

But this shirt was a disappointment.It was so scratchy when I opened it that I couldn't stand to wear it. I thought it might be from leftover sizing in the fabric, but it didn't get any better after washing. I even tried the ""soak in brine"" technique, which softened it a bit, but it's still scratchier than my other t-shirts. Four washings so far, and it's still scratchy, though it is getting a little better with each washing.I have other pocket t-shirts of comparable thickness from American Giant and Key. Both are much softer and more pleasant to wear than this one, even right out of the package.On the pro side, the fabric is thick, and the size is good.

They have a very sturdy feel to them and provide excellent support and cushioning.So, why did I deduct two stars?  First, while I said the fit was somewhat small, this is not strictly accurate.  When they are on, they are comfortable and my toes do not contact the front of the sandal, even walking downhill.  It was only after I got them that I looked at the manufacturer's website and noticed the Fit Tip that said this style tends to run about a 1/2 size small.  That annoyed me because if it was true, they should have relabeled the boxes these sandals come in to reflect the true size. One shouldn't have to go to a website to learn this.  But, remember when I said somewhat small isn't strictly accurate?  What is wrong is the amount of space you have to get your heel into the sandal.  If you have thicker than average ankles (or if your ankles swell), getting the back strap over your heel is a chore.  The back strap needs to be about 1/4 inch longer.  That would make getting your foot into the sandal easy.  Possibly this would be solved by getting 1/2 size larger, but then I'd have a sandal larger than my feet.One last thing.

A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B000051SEN,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""","[6, 7]","To my way of thinking, there are only TWO factors which keep the Vector from receiving a full 5-stars here.  #1 is the watch face.  It is not very durable.  It isn't even glass.  It's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic.  I own several watches, and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat, but this one takes it to a whole new level.  I'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode.#2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters (ie 300 feet) this watch isn't...FAR from it.  You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower.  The humidity alone may cause problems.  Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now, with that said, if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can, the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas.  It'll tell you the temperature (under the right circumstances, of course), help you predict the weather, give you a bearing on where you need to go and then (after proper adjusting) tell you your altitude.  I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh, and those reviews I have read on-and-off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do, and it's limitations, I believe that the price is a bit high (you can buy a Casio watch that'll do the same thing--and is solar-powered, AND is REALLY water-resistent, all for LESS) but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches, or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with: that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings.  If Casio add's one to their model, I'll probably become a full-time convert.  If you are looking for something similar, but smaller, try looking at the Suunto Observer.  It's a dang-good-looking watch, but the price is considerably more, so that may be a rather important factor for you (I know it is for me).All in all, Suunto makes great products, but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them (unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use).",4,"Great watch that, despite promises, is NOT waterproof to 100m.",1175558400,2007-03-04 00:00:00

These make quite a statement no matter what crowd you run with. In some ways it can even be a safety measure, as they make you easy to identify in a multitide. Because they are so unique, people that wouldn't normally remember or even pay you a second glance will tend to look twice and/or learn to recognize you - I think that alone makes these worth the money compared to any other shoe.In addition, unlike many shoes, Converse don't mind being thrown in the washing machine for occasional cleaning (just avoid the bleach, or you'll fade them quite fast). Thus, I don't mind wearing these everywhere, because if they get dirty it's no big deal.Speaking of fading, pink Converse have to be worn for awhile before they resemble the color of the image shown - they are a bit more bright, deep pink than they appear. They are not ""neon pink"" (a separate and easily distinguished color), but nonetheless pinker than the image.Converse almost invariably seem to run a half size larger, and these are no exception. So if you're a 9.5, get a 9, etc. These were my very first pair, and I'm glad that I tried them on in a store to learn this before ordering - it would have been a rather unpleasant surprise.Also true to most Converse, these have little to no arch support, a thinner sole compared to most modern shoes (i.e. you'll feel it if you step on a rock or such), and don't take too kindly to being worn in the rain, mud, snow, etc. I certainly wouldn't run a mile or take a hike in them.

I've been crying ever since my breast augmentation (I didn't even go that big just from a B to a C cup) but since that 2 months ago I'm like ""HOW AM I GOING TO RUN WITH THESE ON MY CHEST???!!!"".  I love running... SO, got on the WEB and Enell came  up right away for BIG chested gals or women like me who just FEEL BIG chested (suddenly).  YES!!!! I'll have to chime in now with all the people here who say IT'S TRUE!  This is about as minimal bounce as you can get... even I (34C) had to lie down to do the hooks, but once they're done - it's done!  No adjusting or tugging or pulling (you can't it's a total body HUG).  And I love that.  Suggestions... PLEASE replace those (swearing) hooks with an industrial strength zipper!  You know, the kind that comes on your Ski Jacket???  The really can't ruin kind of zipper... with maybe ONE hook at the top just to make sure it stays zipped.  Also... Yes, I've read the Enell website - WHY the ""LOOK LOOK I HAVE BOOBS!"" screaming seem is there... (for stability and separation) but PLEASE - WE HATE THE SEAM!!!Colors... I'll wear black.. white? NO way, looks goofy, Pink?  Doesn't fly with me too girly whirly (but that's just me)... beige?  What?  That's the color of my underpants I don't want anyone to see no way.  So it's the black... MAKE MORE COLORS THINK THE RAINBOW AND EARTH TONES AND SOLIDS --- WHAT ABOUT SOME PATTERNS TO DISTRACT FROM THAT HORRIBLE SEAM?  Okay... on the whole, I like the bra alot - it works with minimal bounce... I have the Maia bra coming (Moving Comfort) let's see which works best.  Hmmmm.  I bought size 0 &lt; my best guess for 34C+ a little bit and it's great.  I even think this bra improved my posture while running, no more 'hunching' and tensing my shoulders trying to keep the OTHER bras on, in place or secure...  Okay.  Over and out.  Buy ONE, Try ONE.  One is really all you need, unless you run every day - then you'll want two - one to wear and wash and dry (I wash mine in the shower and roll in a towel and hang to dry) and one to wear the next day while the first one dries &lt; it's just easy not necessary though / I'm sure they do fine in the washer - but I wouldn't risk it due to the hooks.

A6KUDV7C36340,B00020J16M,Purple Recluse,"[0, 0]","I really like the functionality of the Ironman watches. I like this one in particular because it's on the smaller side. The watch features 3 alarms (with day-of-the-week options), 2 different count-down alarms (and one allows you to set multiple successive count downs of varying lengths), a stopwatch and 2 timezones. It's very easy to use, and gives instructions on how to set various things. I liked this watch so much that I bought a second after the first one broke.Unfortunately, every one of the Ironman watches I've owned have failed in the exact same way - the band. There are little rubber tabs that fit into the watch case, and they are the only thing that connects the band to the watch. If the rubber tabs get stretched or torn, then the watch case falls out. To be fair, the band is definitely comfortable, and the curvature of the band makes it fit sturdily without being too tight.The bands have lasted between 3-14 months, so I've been buying a new $30-$40 watch once a year (or so) for the past 6 years. I've been unable to find watch band replacements, and I'm not sure that I could do it myself anyway. The warranty specifically says that it does not cover any problems with the band of the watch. At this point, there's a clear financial incentive for Timex to pair awesome watches with bad bands. If you search the reviews for Ironman watches, so many people just buy a new watch when the watchband breaks, rather than try to get the band replaced. I'm boycotting the Ironman watches because of this.It looks like the Timex Expedition has most of the features I want, so that's what I'm going to get next.",4,"Great watch, TERRIBLE band",1285977600,2010-02-10 00:00:00

The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules.

I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.

Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, ""Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone.

Takes a small screwdriver to pry up the clamping clasp. Easy.*Good locking safety clasp. If the catch gets loose, just give it a little pressure from pliers and it becomes tight again.*Super low profile. Sits close to your wrist which helps out on the first ""con""Cons:*All Skagens have low-quality glass. It does chip, scratch, etc. I'm very hard on watches so it's definitely taken some abuse.

A3I1BJIFFM4S21,1617160377,Atomicwasteland,"[8, 8]","Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English.  you will only see pictures and hear Italian.  This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a ""male"", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said ""PO"" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the ""putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them"" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.",4,"Nice system, but way too expensive.",1340150400,2012-06-20 00:00:00

When they arrived, they only had 5, more like cheaper brands that don't have as much ""attention to detail"" as the better ones.  I was so used to the 7 loops on my previous jeans, that 5 just doesn't ""feel"" right?  Does that make sense?  I decided to keep them, and to be honest, they are comfy and durable and very nice to wear, they look good too!  But, I wish I had the 7 vs. 5 loops.  It may be a ""small"" thing in the grand scheme of things, but it bothers me that their product description doesn't mention number of belt loops, but the photos all show 7 loops, but that isn't what you get.

I have bought the dark stonewashed, black and silver fox. The silver fox was a thinner and softer type of material and I liked it a lot! The best thing about ordering your jeans through amazon is that you can always find your size. I have always had a hard time finding 36x36 in the 505's. It's minimally more expensive but at least I know they will have what I need. No more frustration of hunting through the stack of jeans at a store hoping that someone put your size in the wrong bin!4 stars because these jeans are still no where near the same quality of the jeans I got in the early 80's when they were made in america. I hold onto them hoping I will eventually fit back into my 34 waist. If you have any original levi's before 1985 I would hold onto them. They are in great demand. They have everything going for them. They are high quality original Made in America blue jeans and are now retro. win-win. if you have ANY levi's from the 50's and 60's they can easily command $500 or more depending on the condition.

After a few hours the wiring could irritate your skin. I wouldn't suggest it if your skin is sensitive.2) If you are curvy, as in you have the COLA body, with a little bit too much tummy, and waist, that you would like to completely hold in, I would go a size down. There was a chart recommendation below this rating by a reviewer for sizing. I used that chart it was a perfect fit, but not really what I was going for. I bought the clincher to suck in some unwanted fat and to try and retrain my tummy muscles to retract. The waist line part adds on more curves. If you want a sleek clean look go a size smaller.3) If you like to wear fitted clothes that shows the smallest wrinkles if you wore something inside than I won't suggest this. It shows the clippings inside. The boning (wiring) inside shows. I bought a white one to wear with a white dress and it shows.Positives:1) Material is PERFECT!2) Clippings inside are durable3) Shows up before the expected date4) Washes great in a laundry bag5) Although mine was not as tight as I wanted it to, this actually pushes my water weight down and now I am going for a size smaller :) I want to have a dramatic change to my physical appearance.

A2HHMQPWBJ0XVY,B0000C321X,Jeffrey the Barak,"[1, 1]","There are Levis and then there is everything else. Jeans should have the Levis stitching, tab and patch on the back or they are simply something else. Having said that, buying Levis is not easy. The styles are named with numbers, but over time the shape of the jeans changes. Today's 501s are not the same shape as 501s from a few years ago, and my 501s are much wider below the knee than the photos of 501s on Amazon or on Levis.com. Not the same at all. And I bought mine in the Levis store in Beverly Hills where they cost more money, and I still had to try on several to get the right size, and the sizes printed on the patches is only a rough guide.Most reviews here focus on the offshore production and quality issues. I have not had any quality issues with any foreign made Levis so far. But I have had issues with sizing consistency, which is why buying jeans online is not worth the trouble of returns and exchanges. Sort it out in a store's fitting room before you ever buy them.Today's fashion is for a slimmer jean, but if you try a 514 Slim Straight you will see that not only are they slimmer, but they also have too much fabric at the butt and they want to sit lower, and the pockets are too low. 505 Straight Fits, which in theory should be la lot like 501s with a zipper, are completely different from 501s. The 505s that I tried, while all slightly different in shape, all had a bizarre flare at the outside of the thighs, a much narrower leg opening, a slimmer lower leg, and again, they want to sit at the hip and give you a big empty space at the butt. The pockets are so low that your legs look a foot shorter. Not attractive at all. Perhaps if your thighs, hips and buttocks are more plentiful and curvaceous the 505s may fit more normally. They may be called Straight but they are not for straight figures, quite the opposite. You need fat and curves to fill them out. 505s fit quite terribly for my figure, except for the black ones, which share only the name 505 with the denim ones.So the age-old classic 501s still flatter the typical male form the best, despite being quite wide-legged by today's standards. But again, if you have saved your old jeans over the years, you will clearly see that 501s are always changing. The waist rises and falls and tapers in and out in relation to the hips, the legs widen and narrow, the pockets get larger and smaller and higher and lower, and further apart and closer together, and only the name remains constant over time. And no revision warnings are ever issued.One other reason to try on and buy in a store, 501's come in many colors and almost no two are made from the same fabric. There are so many different weights of denim, each with a different fit, that you have to compare the fabrics by standing, sitting and squatting in a fitting room. So take a quiet weekday morning off, go to a department store or a Levis store, and invest an hour or more to find your next great Levis in the stack of unpredictability. Buying online is unlikely to get you that perfect pair.",4,"Don't buy online, try on several in a store.",1357171200,2013-03-01 00:00:00

Until now, I have always stuck with Carhartt bib overalls, but recently decided to try out a few other brands. Since my experience is solely with Carhartt bibs, that will be the standard I compare the Dickies to. I have only had the Dickies overalls a few days, so I haven't had a chance to put them through the extreme real-world test of flatbedding, so my rating does not take experienced durability into account, only my initial impression and best guess as to how well these will perform over time. As I do with many of my reviews where durability is important, I plan on updating this in a month or two to reflect what I encountered with the overalls in the field.These bibs (as well as the other model of Dickies I'm trying out) have a much longer actual inseam than my other pairs of Carhartt bibs. In most slacks and jeans and Carhartt bibs, a 30"" inseam just touches the floor if I'm barefoot. With these and the other model of Dickies I'm trying out, the pant legs are so long that I could almost sew up the ends and forego socks. The ends of the cuffs terminate under the balls of my feet, when standing barefoot. This isn't an issue with me because I like using a Velcro strip to tighten the cuffs around the uppers of my boots to keep dust and bugs out; but I'm sure most people will want to order these a size or two shorter than their normal inseam length. I did order one size larger than my Carhartts and they fit quite well, so my recommendation is to order one size larger and one to two sizes shorter.The overall quality of the stitching appears to be decent. The fabric is a little stiff compared to a brand new pair of Carhartts, but it did soften considerably after the initial wash. I'm sure after a few washes they will be as comfortable as my other bibs. I think my Carhartts appear to be made with a little bit more exacting standards, but the Dickies don't look bad at all. I do like the wire hook style employed on the Dickies straps better than the spade design favored by Carhartt. While I only wore them around the house for a short time, the Dickies closure design seems like it will be less likely to twist and bind up (nearly impossible, in fact).In summary, the Dickies bibs are four star product, at least upon initial inspection. If they hold up to my regular abuse, I'll have to give serious thought to upgrading their rating to a five, even though they their inseam does run quite long.",4,May Turn Into Five Star Bibs if They Prove to be Durable,1373241600,2013-08-07 00:00:00

I will say that it does not look as good with looser (re: no delineation of form), sleeveless tops that have a high neckline because while this bra provides separation and lift, it my breasts are positioned farther apart than I normally prefer. It still keeps them within the frame of my body, which is what you want in a bra, but I do feel wider up top if I wear the above-mentioned tops. I could be having this issue because I decided to try a 30G instead of my normal 32F since whenever I check a calculator, it recommends the former size. The band feels good at a 30, but the cup might not be quite right. This is probably good evidence that you should always try on bras or their brands in-store before ordering online with a vendor that doesn't have the best return policy.

I love these bras because they are comfortable, they provide good support, and they don't tend to create any lines under clothes. Good basic bras.However, in the past year or so I've noticed a change in the sizing. Ever since I started buying these, I've been a 38B. Last year, though, I bought two of these in 38B to replace two others that I'd worn out, and the new bras felt waaay too small -- they cut in around my ribs and across my chest (which created a  wildly unflattering, spilling-over silhouette under my clothes! That had never happened with my old ones). To be fair, bras tend to fit snugly when you first buy them, but when I compared the new ones with the older ones, the cups on the new ones were a lot smaller: they did not come up as high across the front, and they were narrower across the bottom. I wonder if Maidenform switched manufacturers or something, because until then I'd always found the sizing consistent for this model, even across different colors. I decided to go up a size and see if that helped, and it did: the cups on the new 38C are about the same size as those on an old 38B (perhaps a hair larger across the bottom, but they give me the right coverage on top).That said, I do still recommend this bra because it is comfy and well-made, but I'd suggest going up a cup size over your normal size to get a good fit!",4,"Good bras, but the sizing has changed in the past few years",1381363200,2013-10-10 00:00:00

The color/wash I purchased was called ""Aged Perfect"", which looked like an indigo jean worn for about a year in the pictures. The actual color/wash was close this time, but it looked more contrived then in the pictures. This is fairly typical and it wasn't that far off, this time, but it would have been better if it didn't look like someone had accidentally left a belt sander on them.Another reason I purchased them was because this particular color/wash offered a heavy fabric weight of 12.5 ounces, which doesn't compare to Levi's of the past, but is heavier then many offered today. This is the same fabric weight offered for most shrink-to-fit models, but even though I knew it would seem less heavy due to all the distressing and washing, I'm still amazed by how much lighter they seem compared to my STF's, even after my STF's are well worn and have no starch left in them. And yet, they're still heavier then most colors/washes of pre-washed 501's, and better too, in my opinion.The fit is quite good, although they seem a little roomier then in the past. Unfortunately, I'm so used to buying my STF size that I forgot the sizing is different with pre-washed 501's. This isn't a problem for the waist, but unlike washed STF's, the inseam is about 2"" too long. This isn't a huge deal, because I like the idea of having them tailored to fit better, anyway.Overall, I'm mostly pleased with them, but I still prefer STF's and probably won't be buying another pair of these anytime soon.",4,Compared to STF's,1382572800,2013-10-24 00:00:00

My only complaints would be that the front pockets are cut at a slant that if you lay down in them or even sitting in the car your change/keys fall out of your pockets. The other complaint is that they come with a crease in them and while the crease came out after several washes and a few passes with an iron, I don't see the need for the crease in work pants.

Any reservations I had that they look funky went away when I wore them a couple of days and got hooked on the feel and how they protected my toes.SIZING ISSUES: If they do not feel right when you put them on, you may have the wrong size. Most people that buy Keens find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoes, so try that.COMFORT: The sandals have a wide toebox so that your toes are not cramped together. The protective toe guard does the job, I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these, plus I can hide my ugly toes. It also has a little rise on the rear heel that cups your heel, but also helps protect you against those people that step on the back of your foot in line. It feels very secure once it is on and does not slip. There are no straps to fool with or Velcro to adjust, it has an inner lining on all the straps that looks like the neoprene on a scuba suit, it stretches to fit and is comfortable against my skin. It has a no-lace closure and you adjust it once, from then on it slips on easy. The footbed cradles my foot really well. It has a little ridge on the inner sole that runs behind the toes and in between your big toe and other toes. The first time you feel it, it seems like a defect. But that ridge seemed to shape to my foot, giving me my own custom fit. I hate to gush about this, but the shape of this shoe allows my bad feet to stand longer and walk longer. I actually enjoy running in them, and for a sandal that is a definite first with me, as they usually slip and flop all over on my feet. You can even wear it into the water like a Teva. If it gets wet, for some reason you don't feel it due to the material that wicks the water away.GRIP: It has an outer sole that is very grippy, it gives good traction on sand, boulders, mud, you name it. It has not been slippery on wet surfaces, including a boat. The sole does not leave any marks on my floors, and does not hold dirt in the grooves to track indoors.ODOR: It has an anti-microbial treatment so I do not get odor issues nearly as much as with Crocs and other sandals.DURABILITY:  It has held up to daily wear and repeated wettings. When they get dirty, I throw them in the sink, under the hose, in the shower or even in the washer. I wore these almost daily for 4 months straight with no evidence of wear. This includes standing in line all day on vacation at theme parks and scrambling at the beach. Like other sandals, when they were new they left marks on my socks from the dye but I almost never wear a sock with them anyway.SUMMARY: These come in a few colors and in Mens and Womens styles. I have tried 2 pairs of tennis shoes from this company, and the footbed is similar, although the one with a suede type finish (the Targhee) looked like crap in one month. It is still a great hiker, but I can't wear it anywhere else but the great outdoors. The other pair is for urban use, it is called the Austin, and it is has a really nice finish.  My other favorite sandals are Rieker Anti-Stress Jens 09176, and the Dunham Moose Fisherman(designed by New Balance). I used to wear Teva's, and they make good sandals as well.UPDATE March 2010: I do not know if they still make these to the same quality as the model I reviewed here in 2005, but it is now 2010 and my original pair of Newport H2 sandals are still in use so I can't tell. The only issue is they look a little faded now in the straps and one of the stretchy tie strings lays a little crooked. But they still feel great and my sole has held up. I still feel they were a great deal for the price, about $100 back in 2005.",5,Newport H2's are Keen!,1131062400,2005-04-11 00:00:00
A6GMEO3VRY51S,B0000DYKET,microjoe,"[61, 69]","This is one of the most comfortable shoes or sandal I have ever owned. I first saw these on some ultralight backpackers I met in 2005, and they swore by them for comfort and strong enough to climb rough terrain. For a sandal, that just blew me away. I confess I have not used them to backpack, but I have used them on rough terrain and they are outstanding and amazingly ""grippy"". It has little nubs on the carbon outer sole that dig into or grip everything.SIZING:  I have read that most people find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoes, and that was my experience as well.COMFORT: Tremendous arch support. The sandal has a wide toebox so that your toes are not cramped together, and the protective toe guard is great. I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these, plus I can hide my ugly toes. It also has a little rise on the rear heel that cups your heel comfortably, but helps protect you against those people that step on the back of your foot in line. The sandal feels very secure once it is on and does not slip. There are no straps to fool with or Velcro to adjust, it has an inner lining that looks like the neoprene on a scuba suit, it stretches to fit. The rear strap does not hurt your foot. It has a no lace closure and you set it once, from then on it slips on easy. The footbed cradles my foot like no shoe I have ever seen. There is a little ridge on the inner sole that runs behind the toes and then in between your big toe and other toes, it turns out to add to the comfort of the shoe immensely. That ridge forms in a short time to your foot, giving you your own custom fit. With these shoes I find i can stand longer and walk longer.GRIP AND TRACTION: It has an anatomical outer sole that is very grippy, with a nice athletic shape, it gives good traction on sand, rock, mud, you name it. It is not slippery on wet surfaces like the dock, and the sole does not leave any marks on floors. The tread does not hold dirt in any grooves to track indoors. It is great for water use, and can be completely submerged with no damage. If it gets wet,the material that wicks the water away fast.ODOR: It has an anti-microbial treatment that takes away any germs, I do not know how long that treatment lasts though. They do not get sweaty or smelly like my Crocs do.DURABILITY: I got my money's worth out of them for sure. When my H2's get dirty, I throw them in the sink, under the hose, or even in the washer and they come out like new. I wore these almost daily for 4 months straight with no evidence of wear. It has now been 4 years and I still use them more than any other shoe in the summer. I hope they are still made as durable as they were when I bought mine. This includes vacation, in which I am standing in line all day at theme parks and scrambling at the beach. These come in many colors. For a dressier sandal I also like the brown Dunham Moose Fisherman (actually designed by New Balance). These sandals were good enough to get me to buy two tennis shoes from the same company in the last 4 years, an in-town shoe called Austin and an ugly hiker called the Targhee II. In the end, I just can't say enough about these shoes, I highly recommend.",5,Best comfort and durability I have ever seen in a sandal,1131321600,2005-07-11 00:00:00

A58RQ97D4N1QP,B0000722HK,Hotswimmer,"[2, 2]","I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts, also own several each of Under Armour's Tech T-shirts (0382) and the Loose Gear shirts (0084) - I've written reviews on those as well.Ok, let's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt. It isn't for everybody. It's tight - a compression fit, the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights, but on your upper body. Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit, and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that, it's a high-quality, great-performing shirt. It provides a lot of muscle support, and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry. As I said, not everyone will like the fit, especially at first, but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings. Athletes in competitive team sports - football, hockey, etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you don't have a perfect body needn't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support, regardless of what sport or workout you are into. In fact, if you're just a little bit soft, it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks. You can always wear another shirt over it if you're self-conscious, just don't like how it looks on you, or haven't quite burned off enough fat yet. If you have a good physique, what can I say - you're going to look hot in this shirt. In fact, it's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first. I usually wear a size XL in the other, looser Under Armour shirts, but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these. They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight. I love this shirt in black, but there's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you can't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry. UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat, and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off. I've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up, even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat, but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch (a lot!). Either way, I haven't taken any chances.",5,A Great Workout Shirt,1171324800,2007-02-13 00:00:00

A3977M5S0GIG5H,B0001MQ60A,Joel Dauteuil,"[145, 156]","I resisted for a while (years) while my wife raved about her Keen sandals. I like Tevas (Terra Fi 2) and have owned many pairs over the past 10 years. Love them for warm weather hiking, around the water, and general warm/wet conditions. But, I finally gave these Keens a try after wearing out the soles of my Tevas.The reviewers are right on. They feel like sneakers and I wear them all day with pleasure. These are a great buy. I'm going to buy another pair of Teva Terra Fi 2s also but I do love these Keens.Pros:- Rugged build- Great traction (I think the Tevas are a little better but I hardly notice the difference - that's the key detail)- I bought the mostly nylon (not leather) version (brown/bison) and they do dry quickly. My wife has the leather version and they're significantly slower to dry - overnight at least.- Extremely comfortable to wear all day- I never have to adjust these - they stay on my feet in all conditions with no worries- Look good with everything- There is a nice sense of comfort with that toe protector on the front- Wide toe bed - very niceCons if I have to name some (certainly won't deter me from buying these again):- In the sun, the toe bed/cap does get hot on your toes if you hang out in direct sun for a while- I agree with the other reviews (not necessarily on Amazon) that you'll read regarding the ""funk"". Yes, these do get funky/smelly very quickly - much more quickly than my Tevas ever did. But, hey, they're outdoor sandals. Throw them into the washing machine or go swimming with them every 3-4 days and you're set.The ""funk"" reputation worried me a little so I held off buying these but I can live with it. It's not as bad as I expected. And, these are super comfortable!Added after owning for six months:I think the Teva Terra Fi 2 probably have a slight edge when it comes to rafting/boating because they dry in record time and you can really tighten them so they don't shift on your foot. So, I'd give them a slightly higher score in terms of functionality for the very active or career outdoors folks.Also, I do get annoyed at the gravel that gets stuck in the toe bed of these - I can't shake it loose so I have to take them off and turn them upside down. This wasn't an issue with the Teva open toe design and I kind of miss those days. Last pet peeve: despite what my wife says, (she has same kind of Keens) the tread just isn't as good as the Teva's. Conclusion, I have to buy both for the forseeable future - they're both solid products and I won't give up either.Latest and Last Update: the sole gave out in less than a year - literally pieces/chunks fell off. I'm back to Tevas and happier with the much more reliable tread. The Tevas dry much much faster also. I think the Keens are really for wearing when you want to pretend you're doing something active outdoors - they were fine for just walking.2013 update: I bought what must be my 4th pair of Keens now. This pair is holding up much better than the last ones. So far, no problems at all with the sole. And, the stink/funk isn't a problem with these. There does seem to be a new kind of coating on the soles (inside) and so maybe that's helping. Anyway no issues so far and I'm a happy camper.",5,Excellent Sport Sandal - I'm a Fan for Life,1187049600,2007-08-14 00:00:00

I tried them on in a shoe store so I got a perfect fit, which I highly recommend.  I wear a size 10 normally and I have wide feet.  These are 9 1/2 and fit me perfectly.  It is a little bit of effort to put them on and I normally don't cinch them down.  If I'm hiking or need them totally solid for hiking and the like, then I tighten them down.  They are very comfortable either way.  I stopped noticing them at all after a day or two.  Obviously they won't give ankle support, but for day hiking with a day pack they're perfect.  They were just right for Hawaii, which is so humid and muddy.  I was constantly hosing off my shoes.  Throw them in the washing machine and they look new again.  They like any kind of fresh or salt water activity and they are very durable and of course very protective of your toes.  I think they look very good, too.  I put them on over thin nylon socks and then directly into my fins for snorkeling, since my fins have a large foot bed.  Just put on your fins and take off your fins.  It is so convenient.The only complaint I have is that I did notice some foot odor, even though they are synthetic, after two weeks of daily use.  I think my feet are probably less stinky than most people, but given the constant humidity and wet environment in a closed toe shoe, I don't blame the shoes and it's not that bad of a problem.  You can just throw them in the washing machine when they start to smell, too.  I still wear my old super durable and comfortable Teva's for everyday stuff, but for anything else, short of backpacking, I put on my Keen H2's and forget about my feet.",5,"ideal sport shoe, water shoe",1193616000,2007-10-29 00:00:00

The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. You really have to try them on to see how they fit. The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called ""anti-fit"" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing, if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s, unless you don't want the button fly.",5,501 easier to buy online,1173571200,2007-11-03 00:00:00

Material used seems of high quality, and the stitching is excellent. I really like the straps mechanism, as they feel very secure. The main strap also has some kind of rubbery strips on them, which helps keep the strap from sliding off your shoulder (and have your thousands of dollars come crashing on the ground)There is also a smaller hand strap, as opposed to the main sling strap, which is very convenient for helping you precisely lift the bag and place it, which I really like)-discreetness. This bag doesn't look like a typical photography bag, but rather just a standard sling bag. Makes me more comfortable when carrying it though airports, or places that I am not familiar with.-comfort. This bag is very comfortable to carry, even fully loaded, for hours. Because of the canvas nature of the bag, it molds to your body (assuming you pick it right), which makes it feel more secure at your side.Cons.-padding. This bag does not have too much padding, (it comes with a 4 compartment padding sleeve, which i have converted to a 2+1+1 padding sleeve, to fit my 70-200 lying at an angle), and no padding at all on the top. I think the padding is adequate, but probably could be improved.-price. Compared to other equivalent photo bags, this bag seems a little pricey.-weather proofing. This bag does not come with a waterproof cover, though, from what I read from other review, it is pretty waterproof, however, in pouring rain, I'm pretty sure that it will drench through. (not quire sure what you would be doing in pouring rain with your equipment). This can be fixed by packing a large garbage bag with you all the time, tacky but works.All in all, this is a very nice photographer's bag.

A1DORQXHAAR8J9,B000196UJ0,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[520, 537]","I have several corsets and waist cinchers and I have to say that this one is my favourite. I have worn it almost daily since I bought it, and I couldn't be more pleased. Allow me to explain why this is the cincher to buy.1)The difference between corsets and cinchers: I own both, and they both do different things even though most people think that they're the same. A corset makes the body look beautiful outside of clothes (they push the breasts up very high and pull in the waist), but in general (unless you're wearing Marie Antoinette style clothing) they don't look good under an outfit. The breasts become a single lump and the ties are usually quite visiable underneath (which defeats the entire purpose of trying to get people to think that this is your natural figure). A cincher is made to be worn under clothes, to pull in the waist, and to be as invisiable as possible. Therefore they often aren't as pretty as corsets but make much better undergarments.2) Rago rocks! I own many shaper garments, and Rago's are by far the best. Yes, you can find cheaper brands in the department stores, but they won't hold up as well and they won't have the power that Rago's have.3)Of the versions Rago offers on this site, this one is the best. I own the other model which is very similar except that it is lace and has garters, but it doesn't offer as much support as this one and aren't as invisiable as this one. The satin feels wonderful next to the skin and even under clingy dresses this is just about undetectable. Unless you have your heart set on garters, this is the cincher to buy.4) The fit: like many women I suffer from ""Mummy Tummy"", the horrible price one must pay for having grown two human beings in her body. I am in very good shape, but nothing gets those muscles back to their prepregnancy shape besides surgery (I don't have a spare $20,000 lying around and the scar is huge and ugly). This garment instantly takes 2-4 inches off of the waist and allows one to wear fashionable clothes again without looking frumpy or silly. Another bonus is that I stood about two inches taller because it forces you to walk and sit with perfect posture. This gave me back my youthful waistline. One reviewer said that the fit is a bit tight and they run small; the fit is much tighter than what lace materials and cheaper brands offer but that's because it's a high quality product that works! Those satin panels really pull you in, but they're not uncomfortable (I felt like a sausage for the first hour I wore it, but the body heat warms it up and makes it softer without losing any control). I plan on losing about 10-20 lbs. over the next few months so I will probably buy a new one soon, but I'd recommend buying your size according to the chart. Most of the time I can fit into a small because they don't provide as much compression, but this one you need to be exact.Anyway, if you are looking for an awesome waist cincher that is affordable, flattens your stomach and gives you a lovely ""wasp's waist"", and feels wonderful and comfortable next to the skin, this is the one to buy.",5,Review by William's Wife Jen,1224201600,2008-10-17 00:00:00

Silk will keep you warm, without overheating you, that's the nature of the fabric. I love them to sleep in--they are just right. It's not often terribly cold in my area, but when it is, wearing these tops and bottoms is a good solution, to give that extra bit of insulation without bulk.

If you are not sizing up, they are NOT going to fit right, or control what you need them to control. I bought one pair - according to the manufacturer's sizing - and quickly found out that they were too small. Tried the next size up, and got the rolling effect. Tried two sizes up and I was in the zone. They squoze in tight though, so I went three sizes up and found the pair for me. Now, I'm not saying that YOU have to go three sizes up to find the right pair for you, but it is doubtful that the right size will be your normal size. I would start two sizes up to be safe. This seems to be the general consensus from everyone that I know that owns a pair of these.  Besides, who wants to feel like a stuffed sausage under your clothes??  Final word: buy the right size.

On the positive side, this product shaves ten pounds off my appearance, easily.  So five stars for that.  Two negatives though...  First, I ordered a size up (from what is recommended at Spanx.com), as everyone seems to suggest.  They are still VERY tight, and still roll down.  Secondly, I have not even worn them yet... I only tried them on twice with my Maid of Honor gown... maybe had them on for a total of fifteen minutes each time... and all of the stitching on the waistband started to come out in a big, long unravel.  It happened in two different places on the waistband.  If I hadn't bought them so long ago (well in advance of the wedding), I would have returned them and requested a new pair.  Now, I'm here to order another pair, and I think that this time I'll try ordering two sizes up, and see if that stops the rolling problem.  I will save the second, damaged pair as a backup for the wedding day.  Those two issues caused me to take away two of the five stars that these could potentially be (for me, anyway).  One more thing... as it stands now, I couldn't imagine wearing these every day... it really is a GIRDLE!  But for a special occasion, or a night out on the town, yessiree!!

An uncomfortable pair of boxers can make even the most comfortable outfits unbearable. I have tried boxers from pretty much every manufacturer that exists and Ex Officio's Give'N'Go boxer is at the top of the list for the 25 dollar price range. I have read a lot of the reviews on Amazon and the people that say these are the best boxers on the market simply dont know what they are talking about. I dont know if they just aren't very good at judging underwear or if its that they simply haven't tried the better brands that exist. Either way there are better boxers out there, its just going to cost you more money to get them. For example, Cloudveil's boxers are not only more comfortable, they are also far better at wicking away moisture. With that being said they are also 60.00 a pair. Hanro of Switzerland is another brand that is superior to Ex Officio and there are others as well. So again dont listen to those trying to make these boxers out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread because there are better boxers out there. Again its just going to cost you more money to get them.It may seem like I am giving these a negative review but I am not. These are outstanding boxers and I gave them 5 stars. They are extremely comfortable and the wicking properties are decent. If your a really heavy sweater than you might be a bit disappointed in regards to the wicking properties and you might want to think about investing in some of those higher quality brands. I wear the Ex Officio if I am going to be doing light to moderate activities. They are perfect for traveling. If I am going to be doing more strenuous activities like working out or skiing then I definitely reach for my higher quality boxers like the Cloudveil.Bottom line - While these are not the best boxers out there as some have suggested, they are one of the best boxers out there in the 25.00 dollar price range. They have a nice fit, are extremely comfortable and have decent wicking properties. If your looking for the most bang for your buck then you should definitely try a pair of these. Odds are you will wind up buying more! If your new to Ex Offico then I highly recommend checking out their entire line of clothing. They are easily one of my favorite clothing companies.

The colorful blue topaz stones first caught my eye, and I think the Celtic knot pattern and ""dangly"" style of the setting enhances their attractiveness.My friend is of Irish heritage, so I felt this pattern would make them more special to her. I became curious about that knot so Googled it to learn more. In case you don't know, Celtic knots are an Irish symbol you'll find everywhere in Ireland from designer jewelery to tattoos worn by rock n' rollers to, of course, the original Book of Kells back in old Dublin. It's not clear that Celtic knot drawings were ever meant to symbolize anything, but lots of modern people think they contain spiritual concepts. The knots are incredibly popular with followers of new age religions, magic societies and all sorts of other groups who want to draw an association with the oldest traditions of Ireland,That said, my friend's husband told me he likes them because they look so good on her and make her blue eyes look even bluer. Isn't that sweet? But most important, my friend loves them...and that's good enough for me!Highly recommended...and the price is right too.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, August 4, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books",5,Lovely earrings for an Irish lassie...,1280880000,2010-04-08 00:00:00

A2SUSD9BX2LLUL,B00020J0ZE,TheBronze,"[11, 11]","I collect watches, primarily analog types, and prefer the classic and military styles. The current trend toward mounting a clock on your arm and calling it a watch seems silly to me and I don't think the fad will last. After all, a fad last a season, a classic last forever!Even though I have a lot of watches I don't wear most of them. When I needed an everyday work watch I went looking to an old standby, Timex. I found this particular model (T40091) appealing because it mixes a simple classic style with some modern conveniences such as a very reliable quartz movement and the ingeneous indiglo light feature. The watch is the perfect size for a full grown man and is made of brushed stainless steel, like a serious watch should be. Upon very close inspection I could find no flaws in the case, the machining was simply perfect.The glass fit perfectly and is flush with the bezel. I wish it had been slightly recessed but its okay. I like how they put a slight raise in the case around the crown to act as a protective guard. The face of the watch is very simple and easy to read. I even like the slightly odd face color. It's somewhere between a dark olive drab and gray and in certain light it can appear black. It gives the watch an older look, as if its been around for twenty or thirty years. The hands are pretty standard and the luminous hands work but just barely. In a watch of this price range its fine and besides you have the indiglo feature so its really not needed. About the only thing I wish this watch had is a cyclops over the date. My eyes aren't what the used to be and seeing that little date is getting harder every year. This watch also has the hack feature so setting the time accurately is easy. I have a habit of checking it almost daily (a little OCD).Things I wish Timex would change...add the cyclops over the date, remove the extra face writing to make it even simpler, make the secondary numerals just a tad larger, change the band.The band is not bad but seems to come a little small. I have medium sized wrists for a man and it fits me on the second to last hole. I seems like they should have made it about a 1/2"" longer. I plan to replace the stock band with a NATO band so this isn't a big deal.Overall, I think you can't go wrong with a Timex",5,A Simple Classic,1271203200,2010-04-14 00:00:00

This one does the job very well at its kind price (can find at a cheaper price online) and looks good as well. It stays very comfortable on my wrist due to its thin and small face. I have a relatively thin wrist (Sz 6.5) so it looks proportional. I can see how this one can look a little small if you have a thick wrist but worth a try anyway. It even looked a little small on my wrist at first but I became to like the look of it as time passed.I also just switched battery on mine since the lcd looked a little weak. It's extremely easy to change the battery too. Just unscrew the 4 bolts on the back, take out the watch inside (it's one piece), open it by opening four corners, swap the battery, then put it back together. Even if you have no experience with battery changing on a watch, you will figure out easily.Overall, I'm very satisfied.The only con if I have to pick one - the light could be a little brighter.

AGVB3UZIPFHEF,B0000TIJ4U,Sheldon,"[2, 2]","I've already been through 3 Timex watches now, but I got this one for my girlfriend awhile back, and I liked it so much I decided to get one for myself.The first watch had the Indiglo feature, which made it perfect for wearing to the movies. The second watch had both a chronograph and Indiglo and an alarm, so I thought that was pretty cool for the price. First the Indiglo went out, and the replacement I got lasted a few months before the alarm went out. So, I'm hoping for better with this watch.This watch is the best looking one of them all, with a very handsome band that would look good at the beach, on a date or in the boardroom. It's a lot easier to set than most alarm watches, and easier to set than most other Timex watches, as you can turn the outer dial instead of the crown to set everything -- nice touch. And, all the instructions are on the outer ring and the back of the watch, so you can lose the instructions no problem.As I said, I got this for my girlfriend, and it's size makes it a lot easier to read than those dainty women's watches, yet it looks good on women or men. Great gift for the money, and the recipient will really appreciate the alarm.I can't give it 5 starts because of my previous experience with Timex watches, but for some reason I keep getting them again, hence the 4 star review. If you want a watch that will last you the rest of your life, and then some, my Omega is over 40 years old, and my neighbor has some Rolex watches that are a lot older than that. But, you should know that when they need service, and they will, each service will cost you a lot of Timex watches.Follow-up: This watch is now 3 years old and still going strong so I've upped the rating to 5 stars.

It's a little stiff because it's very thick and warm--so I've opted to wear PolarTec thermals underneath my motorcycle rain suit (motorcycle rain suits are one-piece, and have a high collar at the neck--so there is nowhere for cold air, rain, or snow to penetrate) although I don't only wear my foul weather gear on the bike.

Merry Christmas to all, and a Happy New Year.  Below is my original post:The product is of very high quality.  The problem is that I ordered it when the weather was very cold.

Do not tell anyone but I take mine to the cleaners and have them dry-cleaned and pressed (no starch), just crisp and casual at the same time; it is an old habit from my military days. Come to think of it the military used button fly's also.I can see the problem of purchasing online vs. store bought is that they use obscure words as ""rigid"" in place of gage (or oz.) Not one did they mention the tab color which is Levi's way of sorting the Mercedes quality version from their Yugo (lighter weight but still from Levi) version.

It immediately asked if I wanted to update after I installed.  It was about a 4 MB update and downloaded/installed quickly.  Need admin privileges to install software.  Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.  The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right.  It kept telling me to say ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone.  I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine.  In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done.  I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?  Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too.  He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.  However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class?  The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost.  So given the high price, I still think this is a good buy if you are a good solo learner.

I also wear Riggs Ranger shorts, which I find more stylish, but for the toughest jobs when I need the most durable material, I go to these.  These shorts, along with other Carhartt workwear, remind me of how I always used to think of Levi's jeans:  Durable.  Rugged.  Tough as nails.The fabric that make up these shorts is 12 oz. ringspun cotton duck.  This, my friends, is heavy material.  It wears like chain mail and looks good over time.  After years of wearing them, they have finally started to get ever so slightly frayed at the hem, just enough to make them look comfortable.  And comfortable they are!Despite the heavy and rugged material, the cut of these shorts is generous, allowing room to move and stretch, and cool enough to wear on the hottest days.  Though the crotch isn't gusseted, there's plenty enough room down there to keep the boys happy, even when the job calls for constant kneeling and climbing.  You can wear these on the job all day and be happy... and that counts for a whole lot.  Mine haven't shrunk and the fit has been spot-on and true to size.Pockets are useful and seem designed by someone who's actually used them to put tools into.  They are right-sized, just the right depth, and durable.  There are two utility pockets on the right, and one on the left along with a hammer loop that actually works.  I really don't like skinny, faux hammer loops that won't take a framing hammerStyling isn't these shorts' forte, but I rather like that.  These shorts are meant for serious work, and they look it.  The proof is in the wearing, though, and not the looking - and these shorts stand up to the toughest use.  I've had mine for years - thousands of hours on the job - and though the oldest ones are stained, frayed, faded, and scuffed, they haven't failed in any way.  Not even so much as a sprung belt loop.  It's reassuring to me that Carhartt has kept up their tradition of tough, genuine workwear and hasn't appeared to lower their quality.A quick word about value...  It seems that the fact that these haven't tried to keep up with style trends accrues to the buyer's benefit:  For as long-lasting and durable as these are, they are a steal at the price current as of this writing.  Don't get me wrong, they aren't ugly shorts - indeed, I think they are ruggedly handsome - but they are clearly work shorts and they'll look the part if you use them accordingly.  I don't know why they are so inexpensive relative to other offerings, but these would be a solid purchase at far more than they are going for.  Big value here for top notch work shorts.If you need comfortable, tough work shorts that will work as long and as hard as you do, these will not disappoint.

A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,1617160377,Comdet,"[1, 1]","I've always found learning a new language to be a huge challenge. Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language. If you're serious about becoming fluent in Italian or looking for more than just the ability to ""try on"" a new language, then you'll want to get the advanced versions (unfortunately, at a much higher cost).It is a very fun way to learn a language.

ASU2T2KJ6N8V4,B000074RL3,Michelle,"[6, 7]","I had a hard time choosing between the size 2 and 3. (42 bust and 37 rib cage)  The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage, but I thought I'd need a 2 to really compress everything.  I'm glad I went with the 3, because if it were any tighter, and it would probably hurt my rib cage.  As it is, it seems just right.When I first put it on, I thought it wouldn't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part, but it works!  There's still some movement, but it doesn't hurt at all, and I don't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me.  In fact, I hardly feel constricted at all, other than in the band around my rib cage, and that part isn't uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says--they minimize bounce. I did several jumping jacks without a problem.  It's really  hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you're wearing body armor, and under a shirt it definitely doesn't look like you're wearing a normal bra.  But I think it looks fine. It just flattens you, and depending on the fabric you're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support.  Turbo Kick and the elliptical trainer aren't places to have fashion shows, anyway, though, so I'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper, OneSweetOne, was also fast.  I ordered on a Wednesday, got it on a Tuesday--one day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012. I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great!  We did a lot of jumping around and bouncing, and I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed aerobics or dancing in YEARS.

It's so difficult to find clothes that fit when you're big and tall (tall, dark and handsome if I do say so myself). I usually wear the same clothes every year until they wear out but now I have bought a new wardrobe, basically. I've spent $500 or so on Carhartt clothes in the past few months and I don't regret it. I wish they would make sweat pants!These are very thick material, really nice design. I don't mind the big logos like some people--I like how it adds extra color and style. These will last me for years, no doubt about it.Also, these are made very loose. I would say 1 size larger than most cheaper clothes. If I wear one of those generic clothes (which I don't mind wearing btw) I usually have to order like a 5X because they are so small. I definatley like a loose fit so it suits me perfectly. However, if you like your clothes to have a classic, tighter fit I would order a size smaller. Their hoodies are pretty true to size but their long and short sleeve tees I would for sure buy a size smaller.So yeah, these are way more expensive than I normally pay. There are t-shirts I can buy at the mall 5 for $20 but they have literally started falling apart just after one summer. So it's worth it to buy these because I know they will last.Awesome brand! If you're not sure then go ahead and buy it because I don't think you will be disappointed.",5,"High quality, loose fit, and I love the pocket",1329868800,2012-02-22 00:00:00

They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved ""Tactical"" version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton.

I typically prefer either an open bottom girdle or panty girdle which I wear with gartered stockings. However, I started looking for a girdle that would provide me with some thigh control as well as addressing my other problem areas. I was a bit skeptical at finding a long leg girdle that would fulfill my needs and still be comfortable and feminine. I am a fan of some of Rago's foundation garments and came across the Rago High Waist Long Leg Shaper Girdle and decided to give it a try based on it's feminine look and my luck with past Rago purchases.It actually fit and looked better on me than I thought it would. I find that it does a great job of addressing my trouble spots and makes my clothes look better on me. It also helps in improving my posture and gives me a more feminine look. My job requires me to spend a lot of time sitting so comfort and posture control are very important. The lace is soft and doesn't bind and I also find the split crotch a very convenient feature. Another plus is that I can wear this girdle without worrying about the legs rolling up if I am not wearing stockings.While the medium fits me well, it can be a bit challenging to get it on. I sometimes use some powder to help it slide up.This girdle is definitely not going to be for all of you girls, but if you're looking for something that you can comfortably wear for long periods of time and that has strong midsection and thigh control as well as aid in improving your posture then you should consider giving this girdle a try.",5,Surprisingly Sexy Long Leg Panty Girdle,1331683200,2012-03-14 00:00:00

So I've tried out three different brands so far, and my most recent addition to my lingerie drawer has been the Panache Tango II balconette Superbra.  What can I say?  It is absolutely the most comfortable bra I have ever worn.  EVER.  Online, the bra does get mixed reviews--you either love it or you hate it, apparently--and I've read speculations that it all boils down to shape, not size.  Personally, I am ""fuller on the bottom"" and ever-so-slightly wide-set, and the shape I find my Tango II gives me is outstanding.  It has a muted retro vibe going on, I wouldn't call the shape ""pointy"" like some others have, but it's not the round look that is so popular nowadays, either.  I don't mind that.My Tango II in 'nude' was a gamble of a purchase, I thought I might be a different size by Panache standards and I was right--so it fits perfectly!  (Note: The first bra in my 'new' size that I purchased for myself, online and with my eyes closed, was of a brand that runs small in the band.  I ordered a 30 and have been wearing it often, but I read later the brand's 30-sized bands ""fit like 28"" and so suspected I'm really a 28 to most other companies' sizing systems [and up a cup size, of course].  So at least with my Tango II, my musings and additional, awkward self-measuring sessions worked out to my benefit.) I am so happy, it is a well-constructed bra that doesn't dig in, it ""breathes"", and it's lovely to look at and wear.  Granted, I've not worn it yet under a white shirt but under a knit top that can be slightly see-through to other color bras, my Tango II was invisible, even with the pretty embroidery.  So it is highly recommended lingerie, at least by this new Panache fan.",5,Absolutely my best-fitting and most comfortable bra,1337644800,2012-05-22 00:00:00

Keeps the girls still so I can go running.  I would not wear it for anything but exercise because after I'm done it would get a little uncomfortable.  However, I've done up to 2.5 hrs of running and done sprint triathlons in this bra.There is only one other bra I find as satisfactory (and only discovered it because Enell would not ship to APO/FPO...and in fact would not even ship to a different address to let someone else mail it to me--my BILLING address was FPO and they refused to service that...so don't try and buy this as a gift if you are going through Enell...obviously that was before I could pay for it on Amazon...but I digress).Despite my unhappiness with Enell, I do love the product and I'm vey happy ordering via Amazon has made purchasing this product a viable option again.

About three or four years ago I purchased this satchel from the Montgomeryville Army-Navy store in Montgomery Twp., PA. Priced at a mere $8.99, I grabbed it up right away. This bag is actually a lot more useful than one may give it credit for. I bought it in olive green and removed the shoulder strap, sliced two small holes in the upper rear portion, and sewed in two small olive green loops to blend in with the original material. I then attached it to my rear bicycle rack to be used as a first aid kit. I adorned it with the proper Red Cross emblem and Cadaceus. I liked it so much, I went back and bought another one and likewise did the exact same thing.Sadly to say with other reviewers is that their bag did in fact break, however, (I, usually in question would like to know just what the devil did the user put in it in order for it to break)? Generally, if an individual is wise, they will see the size and dimensions, and the general assumed weight capacity. In other words, don't put a laptop or a bowling ball inside unless you wish for the satchel to collapse on you.I personally recommend the olive drab color, (that is if you're a military enthusiast or historian like myself), but, that of course is just me. The bag is indeed constructed well, the thick canvas supports everyday, necessary items, books, snacks, binoculars or other interesting gear of small size. The rear board inside is thick cardboard and cannot be broken. I did learn from the army-navy store I bought mine from is that some bags are actually constructed with particle board believe it or not.Overall score:  (A+)",5,Previous Purchase at Army-Navy Store,1352160000,2012-06-11 00:00:00

A2UG220UJU5DO,B0000C9ZBX,"Sayeef Khan ""Richie""","[2, 2]","First of all, this is my first skagen purchase. I came across this watch at my local macy's and looking at the $135 price tag I was hesitant and thankfully I was. I came on amazon and found one for 68 dollars, it was such a steal. Now just to get it out of the way, if you are wondering wether to buy this watch or not, you should absolutely. You will not be dissapointed. The price of this watch seems to fluctuate a lot on amazon so never be imaptient and buy it if it's over 80 dollars, just wait it out and check regularly because I am pretty sure you will find one within 68-79 dollars.Now on to the watch. I'll break it down so it's easy for you guys to understand everythingDial - The dial is a dark blue but, when it's exposed to light, it's reflection looks gorgeous and will capture people's attention without a doubt.Glass - The glass of the watch is very thick and scratch resistant. It also reflects off light and is very shiny and clear. When you see smudges just take a nice piece of cloth and wipe it once or twice and for sure it will look brand new again.Strap - Most buyers of this product complain about how hard is it to make the strap the right size for them. Honestly, it took me 1 minute to figure out how to do it. The instruction manual shows it very clearly, all you have to do is take a screwdiver or any other object that fits in the hole. Just enter the object and push it backwards and the clasp will open. Once it opens just move it back or forward depending on what size you need and just press it down tightly and that's it your done.Strap (look) - The look of the strap is my favorite thing about the watch. The material is very thick and metallic. It is very shiny and reflects off light like the rest of the watch. The reflection of the light on the strap gives the watch the elegant look and people for sure will know right away that it's an expensive watch.Comfort - The watch is very light. When left on sometimes you might forget that you even have a watch on, however since it is summer now I did come across one thing that irritated me. I like wearing the watch a little tight and when your in a warm environment your arm will sweat and make the strap feel a little sticky and make it itchy, but then again 90% of all watch straps will make you feel the same way so it's not a huge deal. Overall, it is very comfortable, light and great for everyday use.Overall GradesPerformance - 10Durability - 10Looks - 10Comfort - 9",5,Watch you will love.,1340236800,2012-06-21 00:00:00

A3NEAETOSXDBOM,B0001MQ60A,Stephen M. Charme,"[1, 1]","I have been wearing these for the past five years. Years ago on a family vacation at a lake with a rocky shoreline, I sliced my toe open on a rock. After that I tried various water shoes and sandals over the years, none of which I really liked. Then one day at the beach I saw a friend wearing these, and he bought me a grey pair for my birthday. I have worn nothing else since.I recently bought a second pair in black, not because the first pair had worn out (they still work just fine), but because I wanted a different color, and think the black pair look really sharp. Here is why I like these.1. This is the most heavy duty pair of sandals that I have owned. While some reviews have noted that they are heavier than other sandals (which is true), to me that does not affect their comfort in any way, or the ability to walk or run in them (I like running on the beach with these because I don't have to worry if they get wet).2. These provide the best protection for your feet that I know of. No worries about stubbing your toe because the toe is reinforced like no other sandal or water shoe that I have owned. It's like having the protection of a work boot.One review notes that sand can collect in the toe area and other parts of the sandal when you walk on the beach. True, but it is not uncomfortable, and I just rinse these off when I leave the beach for the day.3. The bottom also provides solid reinforcement. No worries for me about cutting my feet on broken shells at the beach or slippery rocks at the lake. These have also protected my feet from sharp coral reef and jagged volcanic rocks that I have encountered on vacation. These sandals literally saved me from serious personal injury when a jet ski I was riding on vacation flipped over in an area filled with volcanic rocks--I felt them on the bottom of these sandals as I tried to right the jet ski. Without these sandals my feet would have been sliced to ribbons.4. The traction on these is excellent. I have used these to go into the deep end of an empty in ground pool that is coated with slimy algae to clean the walls without losing my balance. I have also used them to climb on jettys at the beach.5. I wear a medium width and recommend that you size up either a half size or full size. My first pair were a full size up and a little loose. My current pair is a half size up and fits perfectly. But each person's feet are different.Bottom line: I wear these for any water related activity that I do--sailing, power boating, jet skiing, walking on the beach, going in the ocean, even swimming in a lake that has a rocky bottom (it is a little tough to swim with them, but I prefer that to slicing my feet on a rock). I highly recommend them.Shop for price. During the summer you can often find them on sale for 15-20% off.

A3SDDMEUMCN858,B0001YRJSG,Joey Joe Joe Jr. Shabadoo,"[0, 0]","Alright, the first thing you need to be aware of when buying Dickies clothes is this: Their sizes are true-to-measurement. That is, if you put a measuring tape around your ""waist"" (wherever you wear your trousers), and look at that number, that's the measurement you want to buy your trousers in. I used to buy trousers at Old Navy, where they size things way differently. Their size 38 is actually closer to a 40 or 41 (maybe even 42). Not so with Dickies.  So when you buy Dickies trousers, you may have to estimate upward a bit, or better yet, just put a tape measure around wherever you wear your pants, just to be sure.Okay, now that that's out of the way, the trousers themselves are great, but you're going to want to wash them once before wearing them for an extended period of time. They arrive in a very tight and stiff state, a little scratchy and rough. So just wash them once and they'll be much more comfortable to wear. They're sturdy, comfortable, nicer than traditional dickies work trousers in that their fit is a bit more modern and loosely cut. They actually sit at my hips, rather than at my waist (which is how I prefer to wear my trousers.They're really solid, basic trousers, and if you look around a little you can find them in some cool colors, including some pretty wacky colors. I recommend them highly if you're a guy who wants something other than jeans that can pass for ""office"" wear but are still comfortable and durable.",5,My new favorite trousers.,1350345600,2012-10-16 00:00:00

I also carried money and credit cards in it and in extremely crowded tourist areas (like the Eiffel Tower) I wore it under my shirt for extra security.

I bought 2 of these and 2 of the sports briefs from another store about 4 months ago and I whenever I wear them I always comment to myself that they are the best underwear I have ever worn. Whether you are a brief wearer or not, it will be hard to deny that these are not comfortable and functional. I just ordered 2 more of these and four more Sports Briefs so that I can start wearing these more everyday.Waistband: The waistband appears to be made of elastic. So far they have held up after several washes as if they are new. When I wash them I always allow them to air dry so that may be part of why they are holding up so well. The band flexes with you. I'm 5'11"" and 195 lbs and I don't feel it cutting into my stomach which is a plus.Material: I swear this is the best combination of material. Its soft to the touch and flexible enough to allow you to not feel constricted while still offering the support needed if you want to transfer from sitting at a desk to running a few miles.General Feeling: These are a little more spacious than the briefs but fit about exactly the same with just the longer leg. I did feel the seat kind of start to meld together which felt like it started to get a hole but I was able to pull it apart fine.They are cooling and dry quickly in the heat and it appears that they can be rather warm and snuggly in the cold. I cannot recommend this product any more than I already have. The only drawback is the cost. Amazon provides a good deal on these but if they were ever to dip under 10 bucks I would replace most of my underwear drawer.",5,My new Favorite Boxer Briefs,1351555200,2012-10-30 00:00:00

As written in previous reviews, you can hear the watch tick,, but only in extremely silent conditions, or when you hold it close to your ear.  I actually find this feature to be pretty cool, reminds me of sitting in a silent room in school with the clock on the wall ticking during a test.  The strap is comfortable, and not bulky, but may be the weak point--- I'd expect the watch to far outlast the strap, which could be replaced.

A4KU0XJNBH674,B000051SEN,Army O3Guy,"[0, 0]","I purchased my Suunto in 2005 (not from Amazon) and wore it daily from then until 2013. It has good to combat twice, multiple airborne jumps, and EVERYTHING! I had to replace the band once during this time (loctite my friends, loctite) and the battery just a few times. I am going back to Afghanistan in a few months and considered getting another Suunto, the Core, however, the reviews seemed pretty bad so I decided to get a new battery and keep the Vector. When I was stationed with the Special Forces, this watch was an issued time piece, and EVERYONE got one who was deploying to Afghanistan back then. I wasn't deploying at that time, so I purchased mine since everyone else had one. The face is large (52mm) and a majority of the painted numbers have rubbed off, however, the watch has never failed me. I seldom use the Compass or other functions, but when I did, they where dead on. Actually, one time flying on a mission I compared my ATLI reading with the planes instruments and it was dead on. Also, when I used the Compass for radio antenna set up, it was dead on as well. Actually, when doing land navigation testing, these watches aren't allowed because you have an advantage. In all, I have considered getting other Sports watches but this one has yet to let me down. When it does, I will stick with the Suunto Vector due to the lackluster reviews of the Suunto Core. The price has gone up since 2005, in which I paid $150.00 via an eBay sale, those days are apparently long gone. I've gone swiming, and even light diving and had no issues. The alarm works well, and the computer does all the fuzzy math so you don't have to worry about shorter months, leap years, blah blah blah. A solid product. If you know someone who is in the military have them purchase it for you because they are cheaper on military bases.My only advice would be to get some loctite to reinforce the screws. You can take it to a locale jewler and they can perform this service for you, likely for free.",5,Purchased in 2005...STILL GOING STRONG!!!!,1372723200,2013-02-07 00:00:00

However, Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian. This allowed me to keep the travel book with frequently used phrases in my pocket when asking questions at shops and for directions, mainly.The main problem was once I asked in Italian the person usually would speak to me in Italian and I had to confess, in Italian, that I only knew a very little Italian. So at least they could understand what I was able to say! Thanks to Rosetta Stone I was comfortable not only listening but also speaking Italian because I had so much practice doing both.I'd give yourself at least 2-3 months before trying this in-country, but the pace in which you learn is really up to you.

A1F7YU6O5RU432,1608299953,Angela Streiff,"[0, 0]","Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.",5,"Suggest getting this 1 level at a time, so you know if you can learn from the program",1365465600,2013-09-04 00:00:00

AU0LLORGK9IDR,B0000868O9,Julie H. Rose,"[1, 1]","First, some sizing notes: This bra runs big in the band. I wear a 30F or a 32DD, depending on the brand/style. This bra fits me perfectly on the smallest hooks. In the long run, that'll make it uncomfortable and big on me, but it's so awesome otherwise, I'm giving it five stars, especially considering the low price.Small band sizes are hard to find. I'm glad Bali makes some 32 bands. Most American companies do not, and those of us with the unfortunate combo of small band size/large cup size usually have to purchase very pricey European brands.  That's another reason I'm giving this bra five stars. I paid sixteen dollars and change for it. It fits as well (and is more comfortable) than most of my fancy high end bras. No, it isn't as pretty, but one does need some plain bras!Yes, this bra is truly old school. It's not stylish enough to be called ""retro."" Has Bali been making this bra since the early 1960's? It looks like that might be true! Thing is, for those of us who are big and saggy, this shape can be very flattering. I'm a small gal with a big chest, and old school bras are really great for my shape. No, I wouldn't wear this under a tight t-shirt, but it's fabulous under any other clothes. I am surprised at how ""natural"" it looks with clothes on, 'cause it really gives one old school torpedo shapeOn to the scratchiness that so many are complaining about. Out of the package, this bra feels really fake and almost plastic-y. That sounds awful, doesn't it? Well, I don't find it scratchy on, and believe me, I am very, very sensitive. I'm always complaining about bras! This one is very comfortable! However, I would venture to guess that if it was too tight, it wouldn't be. The elastic seems less scratchy to me than many of my other bras, and this weird fabric actually feels quite good on. Another thing is the straps. Some have complained that they fall down. I am surprised by this, too, as I have very small sloping shoulders and I've found the straps stay up easily.Gals, get fitted. If you're wearing a bra that doesn't fit properly, you'll be making the straps too tight, and that's when they start falling down a lot. A bra in the right size is a must. It's hard to find when you are my size, and I wish this bra came in a size 30, but it's so darned close to perfect and such a great price that I'm very happy with it!",5,Another winner from Bali,1373328000,2013-09-07 00:00:00

I definitely would recommend these for any woman who has larger hips and it stretches so over the stomach is actually comfortable then again fishnet is very forgiving for most body types just doesn't have the control top if you are into shape wear or nylon which you usually have to go a size larger but I always loved fishnet for that comfort and stretch without feeling confined or uncomfortable. They do stretch upon wearing them as I tried them on for my outfit I will be wearing tonight but I think a gentle wash and drying should also help with the stretching issue and they are not so fragile to handle but like with me I have long nails so I had to be very careful putting these on.

My 'thing' with them was the bottom opening was always so small.ok for tennis shoes, but for wearing boots, they were too small around the ankle, making the entire boot look too long. simply because they were so narrow, the could not go down any lower on the boot.  hahahaI love to wear black biker boots, with a taller 2' heel for easier shifting thru gears. these 517's are wider at the bottom, so the jean bottom rides lower on the boot, only exposing the very top of my round boots, so it looks sexy for a guy. I have had a lot of compliments from mostly women. they seem to like that look for themselves, most people like a smaller foot / shoe profile.The 517's fit the hips, and butt better too.

I took a shot at these since they're $5-10 cheaper than UA, per pair.I am fairly impressed. They are lighter than UA, and a bit more comfortable. The fabric is thinner than UA, and although it may not last as long (I can't speak to this though), it dries faster and feels lighter on the skin.  On the fit, I'll get specific, these under garments don't have space below the crotch, which I have always disliked with UA. I like the garment to slightly compress my body in all areas, and the UA has that empty space below the crotch that allows stuff to rub together. This gently applies support to all areas.The underwear features the same moisture wicking material, and it does dry fast after a workout.

Anyway, we all Prayed her wallet would be returned and 8 months later somebody put in in her mailbox!!!! Of course the $ was gone but her personal things were in tack.. Today she said she was looking for a new wallet because hers was a little shabby looking (mine is fine because I do 90% of my shopping ""on-line"" with Amazon. (no wear and tear shopping on line) My Mom said she looked in a few stores and wanted a wallet w/ the change purse attached and hasn't found one yet. Well of course I went on Amazon typed in buxton wallets and in 30 seconds I found our wallet. I called my Mom and just asked what color she wanted.. She said black would be just fine again.. I have just started my Christmas shopping!! Since my Mom doesn't ask for anything it's hard to buy something I know she would like AND use. So, thank you for still having this wallet on the market. I am going to fill up the credit card slots w/ store gift cards for Her. So a $21.00 plus gift turns into a $220.00 when it's opened. I also ordered the key chain/store scan card holder for her. (Mom doesn't keep her scan cards on her key chain so I think she might like it--I ordered it in red so its easy to find) I may just order myself another wallet just to save in case its discontinued... Great organizer/wallet...",5,Perfect wallet !!!!!!!!!!!,1379808000,2013-09-22 00:00:00

A1FHUYGO3OWWRF,B0001ZNZF6,A photographer,"[0, 0]","I've been a briefs guy for all my adult life.  I recently tried and liked the the ExOfficio Give-N-Go nylon briefs enough to switch from cotton.  I was happy with how the ExO nylon shorts fit and held up.  I decided to give the boxers a try since even the ExOfficio briefs can feel a little hot and restricting during hot, humid summers.  After trying a couple of pair, I might be willing to switch my preference to boxers--at least seasonally.Previous boxers I had tried would bunch up in the crotch and feel worse than overly tight briefs.  The fit of these shorts is loose and comfortable but the legs are trim enough to stay in place.  They're not as supportive as the briefs (as should be expected) so don't expect them to keep the guys in one place all day.  But the non-restrictive fit definitely feels cooler and drier with hot weather exertion.ExO advertises their nylon shorts for travel wear.  They are light in weight, wick moisture and dry quickly.  All true.  Although I have several pairs of ExO briefs and boxers these days, I still hand wash those I wear virtually every day in the sink with Woolite, roll them in a towel and dry them on a hanger.  They clean up quickly, rinse clean and dry in just over an hour under air conditioning or outside in hot, dry weather.  I expect they will meet all the requirements of the frequent traveler with limited packing space.The only negative I can come up with is very minor.  The dark palm (green) shorts continue to give up their dyes with every washing.  I have several pairs of briefs and boxers in charcoal, black and dark palm and the green ones, even after several washings, still turn the water a light green.  The dyes never come off on my body but those dyes sure do run with the wash water.  Not a biggie, just so you know.  Of course, these shorts are expensive--that's a given.  Accept it and move on.  These shorts are actually worth it.As for fit, I ordered the XL and probably could do with the Large.  They fit loose but that adds to the comfort.  If your normal size is XL, I'd stick with that size unless you like tighter shorts.  At no time do the XL size feel like they're going to fall off my hips.",5,Very comfortable,1379894400,2013-09-23 00:00:00

It is difficult for me to find my size anywhere, let alone find a bra in my size that actually fits and flatters AND is comfortable, but this bra does all those things.  I hardly even know I have it on.  No gaps, no digging into my side, no tugging it down in front every time I raise my arms, and it is very smooth under my clothes.  Nice shape, washes well.  I'm in love.  The beige is a bit darker than I was expecting.  I have very fair skin, and the beige is several shades darker than my skin tone, and darker than my other beige bras.  It still doesn't show under clothes much, but I might have trouble with it under white or sheer clothing.  I will be on the lookout for a pale pink or maybe the bisque color will work better in that regard.  But otherwise, perfect bra at a decent price.

I still love this bra. Some advice, wash it on cold and hang to dry. I accidentally put my gray one in the dryer once, and I've noticed it's not quite as firm of support as it used to be. But the Black and Tan dot one is perfect, and the material of it is a bit thicker than the gray heather. I have no issues with seam lines as I read in one review. Also, I often undo the top 3 or 4 clasps if I have a low cut top, and then have an awesome cleavage showing bra. For the price and the large size I need, this bra is great! I do wear a 36 band in all bras and this one is no exception, so I have not found the sizing to be off. I'm still hoping you will introduce some more fun prints. The Black and Tan dot is nice, but I would love some other options!Boy do I love this bra!! I need a 36I, and I can only hope for a ""boob tube"" situation with most any sleep bra. UNATTRACTIVE!!! But this bra actually separates the girls in to two actual breasts! I am impressed! And it's very comfortable!! I find that any day I am staying home, I just wear this bra all day! I am also a breastfeeding mom, and while I wouldn't recommend using this bra to nurse away from home, unless you want to be out in public unhooking 7 clasps, it works great at home! I will be ordering more of these. And I love the heather grey!! It looks great under all kinds of fun colorful tshirts. Looks more like I have a tank top on than a bra! And the price is great too!!

I'm 5'10"" and weigh 170 lbs. I washed them twice and the length did shrink about an inch but I have to wear boots with them or they will drag onto the ground at the bottom/back of the legs. These are well worth the price. Being my first Bibs, I expect to buy a new one yearly, but in a size 40x30.Update:Now that spring is here, these bibs are great and worked perfectly! They are must have in Colorado. When washing them, follow the instructions!I recommend going to your local Carhartt store (Sears?) and trying a pair on to get your sizing perfect. Even if they don't have the lined bibs, they will have the unlined and it's so important you get the length of your bibs right or you will ruin them as they rub on the ground.Next Fall I will buy the unlined version in a different color and may get a size of 38x28. The reasoning for the 38 instead of the 40 is that the lined pair are thick and at times with jeans on underneath, it did get toasty.I've been to my local Sears and have tried on the unlined version which are $30 cheaper, but I could see that as long as I had jeans on underneath and maybe thermals under the jeans, the unlined will be just as comfortable. Obviously you want to buy them on Amazon!The length in the next pair will definitely be a 30"" length (instead of the 32 I bought)or maybe even a 28"" length, because they adjust in length at the suspenders.So UNDERSTAND this fact: When they say they are a 30"" in length, keep in mind that's the shortest length they adjust to. So my 32"" in length bibs I bought are 32"" at the shortest length possible and they will actually adjust (at the suspenders) 3-4"" longer than the length stated!!!!",5,Great,1387238400,2013-12-17 00:00:00

Of course  I fell in love with it online that's why I ordered it but setting my eyes on it...it is much nicer looking in reality than the picture. The picture doesn't do justice to this watch, why..The outside beveled edge is so much prominent that once you set your eyes to it, that's what gets your attention! Then the watch face (with the numbers) is like sitting in the well  of the beveled ring. The face color is very nice beige, the band is great; not the smooth leather but the kind of calfskin that gives it its unique character.  I love it, I love it and I'm very sure the recipient will love it too! Where the band is connected to the watch, it is kind of raised/curved some; in other words those who like the watch to lay flat on a surface this may not be the case. It is also a little heavy if you are looking for light weight! It was delivered just in time! For those who share the same taste... You will love it!P.S. The recipient loved his gift.

AXF514L0AH99G,B0000ANDEI,Wyatt,"[2, 2]","I grew up on a farm (and am now 38), and still consider myself a farm kid. But back then, I grew up on a small farm and we didn't have enough money to buy good stuff like Carhartt jackets for us kids who grew out of them every year! I've kind of always wanted one, and finally got sick of Columbia jackets with fleece lining that fills me with static or other jackets that just don't last. So I researched and bought this one.Many of the reviews claim that it's warm enough to wear outside as your sole jacket during winter. This winter (2013) in Fargo has been nasty cold so far, with multiple days with 0 degrees F or lower as a daily high! Most of these cold days, I am wearing a sweater under this, and it does the trick for me going from vehicle to building and back, while keeping me comfortable while driving. I've also worn it for longer periods of time outside when it's cold and windy, with a sweatshirt under it, and it has performed very well. It cuts the wind better than I expected, so as long as you have a warmer layer under it, it really is warm enough.I am 6'3"" tall, and about 190 pounds. I also have trouble finding jackets with long enough sleeves. I bought the Medium, Long, and it fits me perfectly!! This is the part I'm happiest about. Even with a sweatshirt under it, it's still big enough.It has lots of pockets. Another important thing for me is enough pockets to carry my wallet, cell phone, and sunglasses. It has 2 large inner chest pockets (one with a velcro top, another with a zipper), and I keep my wallet in the velcro one. It also has 2 outer chest pockets, and I keep my smart phone in one of those, easily accessible, easy to hear if it rings.I am very happy with this jacket, and am looking forward to having it last me multiple Fargo winters!Edited 12/30/13:Just spent an hour and a half tailgating for a football game, at -5 degrees F. I wore a long sleeved dry-fit shirt, a sweatshirt, a jersey, and this jacket, and felt perfectly dressed. I was concerned about spending this much time outside at that temperature with this jacket, but again, with the right layers, it cut the wind nicely, and did the job as expected!",5,"Works for me in Fargo, ND...with layers",1387929600,2013-12-25 00:00:00

A3PE6X32LZGMBN,B0000V9E3S,Cynthia55,"[2, 2]","Well I was skeptical, as I have problems finding footwear. I have diabetes & other problems, balance, etc. so I really can't wear most shoes anymore. My actual size is 6 wide, but they're hard to find. I usually have to get a 61/2, but they aren't correct for my feet. (too long & narrow) So, I wanted to try the 6, even though it wasn't wide. (I have Amazon Prime, so if they didn't fit I could return them free of charge.) They were on sale for $47; I never would have paid full price. When I got them & tried them on I was very very happy to find that they did fit me almost perfectly! They are really great for me. They feel like they were made for my feet! Seem to 'cradle' my feet exactly & provide 'full' coverage. (NOTE the picture.)Thay are not tight at all, & not loose. I like the way they sort of tip up in the front...very helpful so I don't trip. My feet are sensitive, as someone else had mentioned & you will feel those little 'pimples' on the inside. Doesn't bother me though. Wide enough so you can wear a reg. pair/thin sport sock with them. Also, you can put an insole (oder-eater, etc.) inside, as they will make your feet sweat, if you are prone, & your feet will slip around. But... because they are (well-made) plastic, in the hot weather you can just hose your feet down to cool off! They will be great for the summer, but I will wear them year-round with socks. I liked them so much, I just ordered another pair in red, & were $37.  I wanted sage & coral but they don't have them in a 6. My foot is 81/2 inches long & about 31/2 wide. I feel someone with a 7 could fit a 6. BUT I will say they are wide, and someone with a NARROW foot would not fit/like these in any size. Another 'con' I have for these sandals: I, personally, need more height & will purchase 'heel cups' for added comfort & safety. They do look good on me, but this is my style! YES, I would recommend these sandals for anybody, especially with the summer coming up! PS Have worn them every day for a week now :)UPDATE: My red sandals fit exactly the same; that is perfectly! So, I then ordered a third pair in black. Sameperfect fit...These were the only 3 colors of size 6 on sale. I am waiting to see if coral, sage & midnight come on sale soon. I have various/serious medical problems related to my feet. I am so happy I can switch between these colors, and I don't have to spend half a day to adjust my feet/brain to different fits. Sometimes I wear with a colorful sock. Cute with jeans. I have been wearing these, exclusively, all day long. Yes, if I am on my feet too long, the soles get a little sore, but my feet NEVER HURT ANYWHERE, ANYMORE! I will update again in a couple more months of wearing.",5,A Lengthy Review for a Perfect Fitting Sandal....,1398902400,2014-01-05 00:00:00

However, it offers some nice advantages over most others, with only a couple drawbacks. I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly. Not that I truly ever relied on the Comp-Baro-Alti features, because we always had other more advanced devices for that. But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times. And the basic time, stopwatch, alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros:User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do, saves money.Broad array of functions - easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years, good quartz movement.Good water resistance - not a dive watch, but it holds up well, even under several meters of water, which I've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and a large, comfortable band.Easy to read - large face, big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons:Not solar-atomic (like Casio Pathfinder) - however, battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300, but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios, but isn't too hard to figure out.Price - higher than many, but not excessive for what you get.Overall, despite the drawbacks referenced above, I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume the other Suunto models are also good.

A1B7XXNR5DL4TR,B0000868O9,Cindy T.,"[0, 0]","I've purchased this bra for many years. It is never my only purchase. I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out. Wearing blouses or dressed, or even casual tank tops, can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach area look thicker, and your torso shorter.  With this bra, the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at the shoulder straps. No the straps are no elastic and it isn't due to being cheap. the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable. The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they don't have a lot of &#34;give.&#34; They wear like iron and look great through many washes. I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer, nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy the elastic. (sulfates causes sudsing) Try Charlie's Soap. You can purchase it through Earth Fare.  You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle, even the moving parts. What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful &#34;stays&#34; on either side of the bra. These push you side tissues towards the front. Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you aren't used to looking so good. You will be glad not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras. Don't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra.  Inexpensive doesn't mean it is &#34;cheaply made.&#34; Remember to lean fully forward while making the connections so you distribute tissue. Enjoy this purchase. Cindy T.

A3AOUGVJ8R8AIS,B0000868O9,Randi,"[2, 2]","Since I had a need for one, my bras have always come from a certain popular lingerie chain. Mesmerized by their bust boosting miracle bras and fabulous looking models, I really never thought of straying. Problem was, their bras didn't fit me well, and definitely didn't provide me with the shape I desired. Their molded bras made me look saggy and lumpy, albeit bigger, but certainly not flattering. Plus, I was paying $40 to look this way, so I began to look for other options.Enter the Bali Flower Bra.....  excellent support for my small bust and a more natural and feminine shape. No longer do I have one single rounded lump for a bust line, but two shapely, lifted and separated breasts! Best &#34;perk&#34; of this bra, a slimmer looking figure. Turns out proper support really smooths things out and emphasizes the waist line... can't argue with that!!Now, at that other bra place, I generally wear a 34A but since that was not an option, I opted for a 32B and I'm glad I did. The tighter band is actually very comfortable and the cup is absolutely perfect (for once, with a little manipulation, I actually fully fill the cups!).Now, if you're a fan of the rounded molded cups, stretchy straps and a seamless appearance, this might not be the bra for you. But if you're looking for a classic, slightly more conical look, and solid support, this bra is perfect. For those who, like me, enjoy wearing vintage clothing, look no further this is the 40s or (less severe) 50s silhouette you are looking for.Finally, the lace. It's pretty, this is a pretty bra, but should you try it on straight out of the package and determine that it's a good fit but far too itchy, wash it once or twice--- you might change your mind.Very happy to find this bra, I certainly will be buying more.",5,Exactly What I've Been Looking For,1394150400,2014-07-03 00:00:00

After shoveling ice and snow in just denim jeans, I thought it was time to invest in a little comfort. It's always a bit dodgy ordering clothes over the internet, but I decided to take the plunge in case we get dumped on again, sooner than later. Other Carhartt items that I have are of good quality, so I felt comfortable that the Biberall would be good quality also. I was not disappointed. My first impression was that the pants were enormous. My weight fluctuates a bit so I chose a waist size equal to my belt size (i.e., a size larger) and that probably wasn't necessary. Once you're able to climb into these things and zip up the sides, there's still a good deal of room to move around in them. Also, don't be afraid (though it's by no means necessary) to get a shorter length than you would for jeans, since you'll probably be wearing these with boots anyway. Not sure what a shorter length would mean to your crotch... but I guess that depends on how long your legs are, etc. Anyway.

If you could fasten these up around boots it would 100% prevent any chance of snow getting in your boots and they would be perfect.

Anyway, I cannot begin to tell you how much I fell in love with them! When I first took them out of the package, they looked very small, but they felt so amazingly soft and silky it was unreal. They are 90% TACTEL Nylon and 10% Lycra Spandex material and feel like butter! I have never felt anything like it! Trying them on they stretched on very easily and like clung to me like magic! They fit like a glove! The soft silky feeling of them against my skin was heavenly! They do have a sort of wide, very soft 100% cotton gusset, which is a very nice feature too, so not riding up your crotch. Being they are high cut is nice also. So I decided to put them to the test, I Put on my tightest leggings, which are yellow, they show everything. I then was modeling them in my full-length mirror. I was very pleased to notice there was absolutely no visible panty line showing through my leggings. So, yes Jockey kept their promise, No Panty Line. I plan on buying more of them in different colors. I would recommend these to anyone, who like comfortable panties, as these surely feel most wonderful. Now that I know how they fit and feel, I would have paid any price for them! I am very happy! Well see how they hold up, I plan on hand cold washing a drip-drying them too.

This bra actually creates separation while providing appropriate lift (doesn't create cone breasts for me). It's very comfortable as well. As for support, I'd rate it as an 8 on a 10-point scale which is fine because, for me,  a bra that rates a 10 out of 10 for larger busted women has to be so tight and constrictive that it just isn't comfortable. One reason that this bra does provide very good support is that it is high cut enough to keep the breasts in place while moving around.

This bra is also smooth looking underneath sweaters. This is a perfect year round bra to wear under all your wardrobe tops/dresses. This bra stays in place and is comfortable for our hot humid summer days in the south. If you have to wear a bra at least wear this one and be confident and comfortable in all your clothes. I highly recommend this for purchase.",5,GREAT FITTING QUALITY BRA,1405036800,2014-11-07 00:00:00

I ended up buying one for my step-grandaughter this Christmas. She was thrilled with it and just like my daughter used to do, she had a blast pulling everything out, going through it and putting it all back in. Everything is easy to hold, fun to look at, and just grown-up enough to make them feel like this really is their own purse.",5,Really Cute Gift for Little Girls,1389484800,2014-12-01 00:00:00

I bought a pair of Asics and added these insoles and VOILA fabulous .I had shoes that were like walking on clouds with the perfect amount of support for my feet. These also made the shoes last a LONG time when usually I burn through running shoes pretty fast because the support dies even though they still look great.

AMTDEF7SAP17N,B0000ZFHJY,Caelis,"[0, 0]","I almost didn't buy this pair because of the reviewers that claim to have received blisters from these particular thigh-highs: If you're allergic to silicone, don't wear these! I'm so glad I didn't listen to the reviews, because these are absolutely perfect.PRE-NOTE: I am 5'0, 98lbs, with medium/average-sized thighs.1. The fit for A/B is JUST RIGHT (bottom of lace hits just above the mid line of my thigh)- if you're much taller than me or have large thighs, I would get the next size up.2. The lace and sheerness of the thigh-highs are just like in the picture, extremely flattering!3. My boyfriend hasn't closed his mouth yet... I think that says something.4. As far as durability, they seem to be too fragile for everyday wear (Just get a pair of average pantyhose for that), but they are great for bedroom wear and special date nights.5. NO sausage effect! Woohoo!6. These will eventually fall down if you're doing gymnastics (I did a cartwheel test, and they slipped slightly with each move) but they have an exceptional grip that will stand up to walking around and minor rough-housing.7. I would order these again and recommend them in a heartbeat. They're worth every bit of $15 and I got them for 9!Hopefully this helps! (:",5,"No Blisters, All Smiles!",1402531200,2014-12-06 00:00:00
